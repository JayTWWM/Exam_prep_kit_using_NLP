Unsupervised learning (UL) is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The hope is that, through mimicry, the machine is forced to build a compact internal representation of its world and then generate imaginative content. In contrast to supervised learning (SL) where data is tagged by a human, e.g. as "car" or "fish" etc, UL exhibits self-organization that captures patterns as neuronal predilections or probability densities.
