    "What is DBMS used for?":"DBMS, commonly known as Database Management System, is an application system whose main purpose revolves around the data. This is a system that allows its user to store the data, define it, retrieve it and update the information about the data inside the database.",
    "What is meant by a Database?":"Database is a collection of data in some organized way to facilitate its user’s to easily access, manage and upload the data.",
    "Why is the use of DBMS recommended? Explain by listing some of its major advantages.":"Controlled Redundancy: DBMS supports a mechanism to control the redundancy of data inside the database by integrating all the data into a single database and as data is stored at only one place, the duplicity of data does not happen. Data Sharing: Sharing of data among multiple users simultaneously can also be done in DBMS as the same database will be shared among all the users and by different application programs. Backup and Recovery Facility: DBMS minimizes the pain of creating the backup of data again and again by providing a feature of ‘backup and recovery’ which automatically creates the data backup and restores the data whenever required. Enforcement of Integrity Constraints: Integrity Constraints are very important to be enforced on the data so that the refined data after putting some constraints are stored in the database and this is followed by DBMS. Independence of data: It simply means that you can change the structure of the data without affecting the structure of any of the application programs.",
    "What is the purpose of normalization in DBMS?":"Normalization is the process of analyzing the relational schemas which are based on their respective functional dependencies and the primary keys in order to fulfill certain properties.",
    "What is the purpose of SQL?":"SQL stands for Structured Query Language whose main purpose is to interact with the relational databases in the form of inserting and updating/modifying the data in the database.",
    "Explain the concepts of a Primary key and Foreign Key.":"Primary Key is used to uniquely identify the records in a database table while Foreign Key is mainly used to link two or more tables together, as this is a particular field(s) in one of the database tables which are the primary key of some other table.",
    "What is the main difference between UNION and UNION ALL?":"UNION and UNION ALL are used to join the data from 2 or more tables but UNION removes duplicate rows and picks the rows which are distinct after combining the data from the tables whereas UNION ALL does not remove the duplicate rows, it just picks all the data from the tables.",
    "What is a join in the SQL?":"A Join is one of the SQL statements which is used to join the data or the rows from 2 or more tables on the basis of a common field/column among them.",
    "What is meant by trigger?":"Trigger is one of the very important codes or programs which get executed automatically in response to the events that occur in a table or a view. For Example, If a new record is inserted in an employee database then the data gets created automatically in the related tables like salary, department and roles tables.",
    "Explain the Stored Procedure.":"Stored Procedure is a group of SQL statements in the form of a function that has some unique name and is stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS) and can be accessed whenever required.",
    "Where is the LRU cache used in data structure?":"LRU (Least Recently Used) cache to organize items in order of use, enabling you to quickly find out which item hasn't been used for a long time.",
    "Explain the main difference between PUSH and a POP?":"The two main activities, i.e. Pushing and Popping applies the way how data is stored and retrieved in an entity. So if you check in detail, a Push is nothing but a process where data is added to the stack.  On the contrary, a Pop is an activity where data is retrieved from the stack. When we discuss the data retrieval it only considers the topmost available data.",
    "What operations can be performed on a stack?":"Push operation: To add an item to the stack. If the stack is complete, then it is in an overflow condition. Pop operation: It is used to remove an item from the stack. If it's an empty stack, then it is in underflow condition. isEmpty operation: If the stack is empty returns true, else false. Peek or Top operation: This returns the top element of the stack.",
    "Are linked lists considered non-linear or linear data structures?":"It depends on where you plan to use Linked lists. You can consider a linked list for both non-linear and linear data structures. When used for data storage, it is regarded as a non-linear data structure. When used for access strategies, it is considered a linear data structure.",
    "What is an AVL tree?":"An AVL (Adelson, Velskii, and Landi) is a self-balancing binary search tree where the variation of heights of the right and left subtrees of any node is not more than one.",
    "What is a Jagged array?":"Jagged arrays are a particular type of arrays used for storing rows of data of varying lengths to improve efficiency when working with multidimensional arrays.",
    "What is the max heap in the data structure?":"A max heap in a data structure is a complete binary tree where each internal node's value is greater than or equal to that node's children's values.",
    "What is a graph?":"Type of data structure that has a set of ordered pairs. In turn, these pairs are again acknowledged as edges or arcs. These are used to connect different nodes where the data can be accessed and stored based on the needs.",
    "Explain what is a dequeue?":"A dequeue is nothing but a double-ended queue. Within this structure, the elements can be inserted or deleted from both sides.",
    "Explain the process of how a selection sort works?":"A selection sort is a process where it picks up the smallest number from the entire data setlist and places it at the beginning. The same process is continued where the second position is already filled in. The same process is continued all the way until the list is completed. The selection sort is defined as a simple sort algorithm when compared to others."
