    "What is supervised learning?":"In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machines work as the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. It applies the same concept as a student learns in the supervision of the teacher.Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine learning model.",
    "What is unsupervised algorithm?":"Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised using training dataset. Instead, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data."
